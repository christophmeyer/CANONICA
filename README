*********************************************************************************
1. INSTALLATION
*********************************************************************************

CANONICA does not require any installation, the package can be loaded in a
Mathematica session with the command

	 Get["./CANONICA.m"]

provided the file CANONICA.m resides in the current working directory. All 
functionality is contained in this file, there are no dependencies other than 
Mathematica itself. The package has been tested on a Linux operating system
with the Mathematica versions 10 and 11, but should run on other operating
systems, which are supported by Mathematica, as well.

*********************************************************************************
2. DOCUMENTATION
*********************************************************************************

The documentation consists of several parts, which are described in the
following.

An interactive manual can be found in the ./manual.nb notebook, which explains
all relevant data structures as well as the usage and options of all functions
provided by CANONICA. In particular, this notebook also describes the usage of
some supplemental functionality. It is highly recommended to work trough this 
notebook as it displays all of the available functionality.

In addition to the manual, a number of examples can be found in the ./examples
directory. In the directories of the examples a notebook file can be found that
provides a quick illustration of how the main functionality of CANONICA can be
used to transform differential equations into canonical form. 

For a quick overview over the arguments and the output of a particular function
in CANONICA, the command

    ?FunctionName

will call a short usage message if CANONICA is loaded in the current Mathematica
session. This applies to options of functions and to global variables as well.

The publication accompanying this release contains some of the content of the
manual as well as a list of the available functions. An overview over the 
algorithm implemented in CANONICA is given as well in this publication. For a 
detailed description of the algorithm, the reader is referred to the original 
publication arXiv:1611.01087.

3. FILES IN THE PACKAGE
*********************************************************************************

./scr/CANONICA.m

	Contains all of the source code of the program. In particular all
	function definitions usage messages for the public functions and 
	their options.

./manual.nb

	An interactive manual in the Mathematica notebook format that explains 
	all functions and options with short examples.

./examples

	Several examples are provided in this directory. The directory of each
	example contains a .m file with the differential equation and a .nb 
	notebook file that illustrates the application of CANONICA to this
	example. There is also a RunExample.m script in the directory of each
	example that allows to run the calculation of the full transformation in
	terminal mode by calling

	math -run "<<RunExample.m"

	or

	math -script RunExample.m
	
	Some additional information about the examples is provided in
	the ./examples/examples.pdf file. 

./LICENSE

	A copy of the third version of the GNU General Public License.
